      "One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked. They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.  The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.  It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.  I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.\n"

      "Input: office work especially in this era of computers multi functional copy machines e mail voice mail snail mail and temps is territory ripe with satirical possibilities a vein previously tapped in such films as clockwatchers and office space and very successfully this latest addition to the temp humor pool however haiku tunnel directed by josh kornbluth and jacob kornbluth fails to live up to it s predecessors and leaves the laughs somewhere outside the door waiting for a chance to sneak in unfortunately for the audience that chance never comes so what you get is a nice try but as the man once said no cigar as the narrator star of the film josh kornbluth playing josh kornbluth points out in the opening frames in a monologue delivered directly into the camera this story is pure fiction and takes place in the fictional city of san franc l isco it s an innovative if not very imaginatively presented disclaimer and not all that funny it is however a harbinger of what is to follow all of which like the disclaimer just isn t all that funny kornbluth plays kornbluth an aspiring novelist who supports himself working as a temp it s a job that suits him and it gives him time to slip in some work on his novel from time to time but when he goes to work for a lawyer bob shelby warren keith he does too good a job on the first day and shelby dispatches head secretary marlina d amore helen shumaker to kornbluth to persuade him to go perm the thought of working full time for the same company though initially strikes fear in the heart of kornbluth but he caves in and signs on for the position he s nervous about it but at least now the other secretaries acknowledge his presence which of course they would never do with a temp and if things get too rough he has seventeen important letters he s typed up that now just have to be mailed out to fall back on he s been holding them back because the mailing is the easy part and he needs that something easy to do in reserve in case it all gets to be too much for him these are important letters however and by the end of the week kornbluth still has them in reserve on his desk and it doesn t take a genius to figure out that when shelby finds out about it kornbluth s days as the fair haired boy are going to be over and quick the brothers kornbluth who not only directed but along with john bellucci also wrote the screenplay for this film should have taken a page out of the ben stiller book of comedy where it says if you play it straight they will laugh but they didn t and the audience won t because in comedy even looking at it as objectively as possible when the main character as well as most of the supporting characters in this case plays funny as in he knows he s being funny he never is and that s exactly what kornbluth does here so rather than being funny he comes across as insincere and pretentious a grievous error in judgment on the part of the kornbluths because by allowing it they sabotaged their own movie in trying to discern exactly why this movie doesn t work it comes down to two basic reasons the directing which if not necessarily bad is at least careless and secondly the performances beginning with that of josh kornbluth quite simply kornbluth just seems too impressed with himself to be effective here unlike stiller or even steve martin both of whom use self deprecating humor very effectively kornbluth apparently has an ego that simply will not allow putting himself in that light he seems to have a need to let his audience know that he the real kornbluth is in reality much more clever than kornbluth the character and being unable to get past that does him in as well as the film rather than give the millions of office workers who may see this film someone to whom they can relate or with whom they can identify kornbluth affects a condescending manner that only serves to alienate the very people he is attempting to reach so what it all comes down to is a case of poor directing and unconvincing acting and when you take into consideration that the screenplay itself was weak to begin with with an inexplicably narrow focus given the potential of the rich subject matter it s easy to understand why this one just doesn t fly the one saving grace of the film is the performance by warren keith as shelby whose subtle delivery is convincing and which in and of itself is fairly humorous the effectiveness of it is diminished however inasmuch as keith has to share his scenes with kornbluth which somewhat automatically cancels out his positive contributions to the project shumaker and sarah overman julie faustino also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances which are commendable if not entirely memorable they at least make their scenes watchable and overman even manages to elevate kornbluth s performance if only momentarily but it s still not enough to save the day or the film the supporting cast includes amy resnick mindy brian thorstenson clifford june lomena davonne joe bellan jimmy the mail clerk with a cameo appearance by a disheveled looking harry shearer as the orientation leader a role that begs for an answer to the question what was he thinking when he agreed to this in any work environment there will forever be situations arising that one way or another will unavoidably become fodder for someone s comedic cannon and the films depicting said situations will always be with us the good ones see paragraph one may even become classics in their own right haiku tunnel however will

      "Input: and you d be right black mama white mama also known as women in chains is exactly the kind of trashy and crappy b movie that the premise suggests pam grier has been thrown into a prison on a small island with a lot of other women and this place seriously makes the summer camp where martha stewart is locked up right now look like a maximum security prison it s not five minutes into the movie that one of the hottie guards utters the line strip em and get em wet and then we are introduced to a prison life that resembles some college freshman s fantasy of what the inside of a sorority house is like the prisoners soap and rub and wrestle with each other in the shower like it s a girls gone wild shoot then they all hang out together in their dorm openly smoking pot and discussing in a big group what would be the best ways to escape i ve never been to prison myself but i have a feeling that escape plans are the kind of thing that you want as few people as possible to know about prisoners or guards or otherwise the biggest difference between this prison life and some fantasy sorority life is that the women in this movie all wear orange cardigans and no pants go figure that say prison on the back must be those generic prison outfits for prisons that can t afford pricey accessories like their prison name or prisoner numbers for their uniforms and as is to be expected a prison that can t afford to put prisoner identification on the backs of the uniforms can obviously not expect to be able to find guards that are interested in guarding the prisoners as much as they are in having sex with the prisoners and each other the conflict of the movie s title refers to the fact that lee daniels pam grier spends much of the time handcuffed to a blonde prisoner named karen as they are on the run from the cops after escaping from the prison i won t go into details about how they escape except to say that you might have seen something like it in the fugitive had they been unable to afford to stage a train wreck and it leads into the muddled story of the conflicting interests also chasing these two women for different reasons karen and lee both have their own gangs of people each hoping to rescue their respective escaped prisoner and the cops are after both of them all the while spoilers so karen is involved with a bunch of hippies that want to revolutionize life as they know it meanwhile karen just wants to get off the island something she s been trying to do for years and isn t it just perfect that they each need to go to completely opposite sides of the island in order to fulfill their goals so we get this odd couple pairing and since they are an odd couple it s not hard to predict that they will hate each other for the vast majority of the film but grow fond of each other by the end in a movie with so many conflicting interests especially when those conflicting interests not only propel the two main characters in opposite directions as they pursue their goals it is not unreasonable to expect that there will be a climactic moment involving the rival gangs at some point in the movie not about to leave anyone unsatisfied they throw in a stupid gang standoff at the end of the movie where everyone shoots machine guns at each other killing each other en masse while the two women paddle safely and calmly across the river in a little boat nice even better at the end of the movie after a huge massacre in which lots of people get shot and spurt bright red paint all over the place the captain of the police looks over the masses of dead criminals covered in awful awful special effects and we learn that he will be a major before dinner not a bad way to end the movie the criminals all kill each other off and the cops get all the credit but here is the last line in the film it s better to win isn t it is that why the captain is going to get promoted to major because he figured that out, Predicted: [2.3899968e-15], Actual: 0\n",

      "Input: significant spoilers this is a sick disturbing movie just like the sick twisted director jennifer chambers lynch who also wrote it i don t even know why i gave this movie a rating of it is not the fault of the actors for sure the cast certainly portrayed their roles well it is the way this movie was written and the way the characters were written which was the benchmark of a truly sick mind i do know that i will never ever watch another movie which has been written or directed by jennifer chambers lynch she is a sick twisted foul mouthed foul thinking deviant she looks speaks and sounds like some biker chick with her brain fried on drugs who spent years doing hard time you can clearly see what kind of person she is by watching her on the dvd special features section of surveillance the watched are watching you can see and hear her for yourself she was every bit as bad as i had envisioned from the writing of this movie i m not shocked by bad language although this director certainly talks like a sailor this goes far beyond simple bad language worse than any p rn film the level of implied sado violence and perversion she incorporates into every character she writes are of the genre which is even illegal by p rn standards this perverse disturbing thinking is clearly apparent in her own personality and things she says another reviewer found the description i was seeking this is a snuff film be sure to listen to her narration on the deleted scenes and alternate ending this director writer is truly a sick person i can t believe anyone would put her in charge of a movie much less pay her for it you can be assured that i will never ever watch another movie she has been affiliated with in the thousands of movies i have watched and collected there are only a couple directors and writers which have merited this kind of boycott she is offensive beyond anyone i have ever seen connected with filming a movie before there have been some bad directors and writers but none could compare to her sick twisted mind when i saw this movie which was just one murder rampage after another once it got past the hotel murder then the sick cops shooting at and brutalizing drivers for kicks the vacation family with the bad parents who had no business being in the presence of children followed by the drug addicts the movie then proceeded to the even more twisted deviant serial killers as i saw the serial killers reveal themselves i began to wonder what kind of truly sick mind wrote this movie those were my actual thoughts as i watched this movie i fully intended to find out what writer had such a sick mind because that writer seriously needs to be committed for long term psychiatric treatment to my surprise it turned out to be the director when i saw and heard what she had to say on the dvd i realized my assessment of the writer was right on the nose on the dvd she was indeed the sick twisted person i had envisioned writing such a disturbing film while the little girl stephanie ryan simpkins truly stole the show i can t believe that her real life parents would have tolerated this sick foul mouthed director to be anywhere near their daughter this movie is disturbing sick offensive twisted and the director writer needs some serious treatment in a mental facility as far as the ending of the movie goes the alternate ending should have been the outcome of this horrific ordeal there was no point and no benefit to the film or the story or the flow of the film by the death of the other character i m stunned that any studio actually distributed the movie the trailer was completely misleading the only reason the movie got the audience it did was due to the clever wordsmithing and creative depiction on the trailer that trailer is not representative of the movie you will see other than the child every character in this movie was a sick murderous twisted perverse violent sex freak and their characters are mirrored the mind of the writer director who created them but if you watch it carefully even the parents of the vacationing family the sick cops taking pot shots the serial killers posing in alternate roles cops in the station and even the station dispatcher every single one of these character roles incorporated a sexually twisted violent pervert i m not too sure about some of the actors after watching them talk about the filming of the movie and the canadian town in the special features section of the dvd this writer director has such a personal mental deviation that no matter what she writes every character role contains those same carbon copy stamps the only character which did not have these deviant tendencies was the child watch closely and you will see this in every character then listen to the director writer talk on the dvd special features section and you will understand what i m telling you about her mental state and psychological issues she wouldn t be tolerated in too many decent homes if she were not from a hollywood film making family fortunately jennifer chambers lynch does not have much of a filmography less than a handful of things since she carbon copies those disturbing traits in all of her character roles i don t think we ll have to see many movies written or directed by her unless her dad director david lynch helps her out i d recommend staying away from any movie she is involved with and i m not too sure her dad s films would be any better do yourself a favor avoid anything written or directed by jennifer chambers lynch, Predicted: [0.01060474], Actual: 0\n",

      "Input: seldom seen since theatrical release in myra breckinridge has become a byword for cinematic debacles of legendary proportions now at last on dvd in an unexpectedly handsome package it is as unlikely to win wide audiences today as it was when first released gore vidal s bestseller was a darkly satirical statement most filmmakers felt that the novel s story structure and overall tone would not translate to film and industry insiders were surprised when th century fox not only acquired the rights but also hired vidal to adapt his novel to the screen but studio executives soon had cold feet vidal s adaptations were repeatedly rejected and novice writer director michael sarne was brought in to bring the film to the screen studio executives hoped that sarne would tap into the youth market they saw as a target for the film but sarne proved even more out of synch with the material than the executives themselves rewrite upon rewrite followed the cast sensing disaster became increasingly combative in her dvd commentary star raquel welch says that she seldom had any idea of what myra s motives were from scene to scene or even within any single scene itself and that each person involved seemed to be making an entirely different film in the accompanying back story documentary rex reed says that myra breckinridge was a film made by a bunch of people who hid in their dressing rooms while waiting for their lawyers to return their calls the accuracy of these comments are demonstrated by the film itself the basics of vidal s story are there but not only has the story been shorn of all broader implications it seems to have no point in and of itself everything runs off in multiple directions nothing connects and numerous scenes undercut whatever logic previous scenes might have had and while director sarne repeatedly states in his commentary that he wanted to make the film as pure farce the only laughs generated are accidental chief among these accidents is mae west it is true that west is unexpectedly well preserved in appearance and that she had lost none of her way with a one liner but there is no getting around the fact that she is in her seventies and her conviction that she is the still the sexiest trick in shoe leather is extremely unsettling to say the least but worse really is the fact that west is outside her era her efforts to translate herself into a hip and happening persona results in one of the most embarrassing self caricatures ever seen on film the remaining cast is largely wasted raquel welch a significantly underestimated actress plays the title role of myra very much like a barbie doll on steroids non actor rex reed is unexpectedly effective in the role of myron but the entire role is essentially without point only john huston and cameo players john carradine jim backus william hopper and andy devine emerge relatively unscathed yes it really is the debacle everyone involved in the film feared it would be fast when it should be slow slow when it should be fast relentlessly unfunny from start to finish it is true that director sarne does have the occasional inspired idea as in his use of film clips of everyone from shirley temple to judy garland to create counterpoint to the action but by and large whenever sarne was presented with a choice of how to do something he seems to have made the wrong one the how and why of that is made clear in sarne s audio commentary sarne did not like the novel or for that matter the subject matter in general he did not want to write the screenplay but he needed the money he emphatically did not want to direct the film but he need the money he makes it very clear that he disliked author gore vidal and rex reed at one point he flatly states that reed is not a nice person and to this day he considers that vidal and reed worked in tandem to sabotage the film because he refused to play into their homosexual agenda which when you come right down to it seems to have been their desire that sarne actually film vidal s novel rather than his own weirdly imagined take off on it although he spends a fair amount of commentary time stating that the film is widely liked by the gay community sarne never quite seems to understand that the appeal of the film for a gay audience arises from his ridiculously inaccurate depiction of homosexual people when taken in tandem with the film itself sarne emerges as more than a little homophobic and quite frankly the single worst choice of writers and directors that could have been made for this project in addition to the sarne and welch commentaries and the making of documentary the dvd release includes several trailers and two versions of the film a theatrical release version and a restored version the only difference between the two is that the final scene in the restored version has been printed to black and white the edits made before the film went into general release have not been restored but the documentary details what they were the widescreen transfers of both are remarkably good and the sound is quite fine but to end where i began this is indeed a film that will most interest film

exhilarating biography of cavalry officer george armstrong custer the film chronicles custer from the moment that he arrives at west point academy until the indians massacre him at the little big horn this is one of errol flynn s signature roles and one of raoul walsh s greatest epics walsh and flynn teamed in quite often afterward and they died with their boots on reunited olivia de havilland as flynn s romantic interest for the last time they appeared as a couple in seven previous films this minute black white oater is nothing short of brilliant with dynamic action sequences humorous romantic scenes and stern dramatic confrontations between our hero and his adversaries one of the notorious errors involves colonel philip sheridan who is shown as the commandant at west point before the civil war indeed sheridan was a lieutenant at this point in fact the commandant was robert e lee as the earlier flynn film santa fe trail showed another historical lapse concerns lieutenant general whitfield scott scott was not the commander of union troops throughout the civil war warner brothers presented custer as a drinker probably because flynn had a reputation for drinking but in real life custer neither drank nor smoked nevertheless these as well as other historical goofs do not detract from a truly splendid film they died with their boots on opens with custer riding into west point military academy arrayed in a fancy dress uniform with an african american carrying his luggage and tending his dogs after the sergeant of the guard realizes that he has turned out a honor guard for a future plebe instead of a high ranking foreign general the sergeant turns custer over to a ranking cadet ned sharp arthur kennedy of city for conquest to take charge of him sharp plays a practical job on custer by installing him in the quarters of major romulus taipe stanley ridges of task force who promptly runs custer out naturally the volatile custer attacks sharp in a public brawl general phil sheridan john litel of the sons of katie elder is prepared to dismiss custer from west point for conduct unbecoming as it turns out sheridan cannot expel custer because custer has not enrolled once he enrolls custer establishes a mediocre academic reputation with alacrity to fight and accumulate demerits galore when the american civil war erupts west point graduates cadets who have not completed their education and rushes them into combat one of the last cadets hustled off to war is custer avid as he is to get into the fight custer encounters his future wife elizabeth libby bacon olivia de havilland of santa fe trail and they pledge themselves to each other despite mr bacon gene lockhart of carousel who detests the sight of custer it seems that bacon ran across custer at a saloon and insulted one of custer s friends and our hero reprimanded bacon meanwhile back in washington custer desperately seeks a transfer to a regiment but major taipe has him cooling his heels custer befriends rotund lieutenant general winfield scott sidney greenstreet of the maltese falcon and they share an appetite for creamed bermuda onions that becomes one of custer s characteristics not only does scott see to it that taipe assigns custer to the second cavalry but also custer appropriates taipe s horse to get to his command during the battle of bull run july custer disobeys orders from none other than sharp strikes his superior officer and holds a bridge so the infantry can cross it wounded in the shoulder and sent to the hospital custer receives a medal rather than a court martial when confederate general jeb stuart threatens the union army at the battle of gettysburg in pennsylvania scott is shocked by the chance that the south may triumph when a brigadier general cannot be found scott goads taipe into promoting the first available officer a mistake is made and custer is promoted incredulous at first custer embraces the moment and cracks stuart s advance after the war custer idles down and starts boozing it up with the boys at the local saloons sharp shows up as a crooked railroad promoter and with his father they try to enlist custer to serve as the president of their railway so that they can obtain funds eventually libby intercedes on his behalf with general sheridan who was in command of the army and gets him back on active duty as the commander of the th cavalry when he takes command custer finds the th cavalry a drunken lot and is not surprised that sharp commands the liquor at the fort meanwhile custer has his first run in with crazy horse anthony quinn of the guns of navarone and takes him into custody of course crazy horse escapes becomes custer s adversary and they fight once custer has quelled crazy horse and the indians sharp with taipe as a government agent conspire to destroy a peace treaty with the sioux and other indian nations they also see to it that custer is brought up on charges for striking taipe in a saloon brawl on his way to washington custer discovers the perfidy of sharp and taipe who have drummed up a gold strike in the sacred black hills settlers rampage in and the indians hit the warpath custer sacrifices himself and his men at the little big horn in a slam bang showdown against redskins stagecoach lenser bert glennon captures both the grit and the glory the long shot of the th

      "Input: well maybe the pc version of this game was impressive maybe i just finished playing the ps version and it s pretty much a complete mess there are a couple elements that are okay or promising i ll mention those first because it will be over quickly first the idea of a historical gta like game is a great one the game gun was a historical gta like game and unlike mafia gun was excellent i d love to see a game set during mafia s era done right next the storyline is well written the story makes sense it has dramatic arcs it uses an unusual device with much of the game being a backstory and it s interesting finally some of the graphics especially those used during cutscenes are impressive mafia s designers seemed to focus on getting the graphics right in the places where gta skimped on that effort especially the characters unfortunately in many other areas the graphics kinda stink and i d much rather have excellent gameplay than impressive looking characters the gameplay is what sinks this title so low first off the controls and camera absolutely suck that has to be the first focus of any game developers you can t release a game where the controls and or camera suck number one there s no reason that the player s character tom can t have his full range of motion controlled by the left analog stick unless it s absolutely necessary and it hardly ever is i hate the set up where the left stick moves the character in a strafing way and the character can only turn using the right analog stick here it s not only unnecessary it makes most of the simplest actions a challenge for example tom has to climb on a couple missions but the game is designed so poorly that you have to frustratingly keep manipulating both the right analog stick and the camera and then press l every time you need to climb or tom will descend instead next i ve never seen a worse fighting system the first problem is that you can t auto aim or lock on to any targets at one early point the game seems to tell you that you can use l or r to lock on to targets but that never worked so to focus on any enemy you have to struggle with the stupid right analog stick and try to keep adjusting both the character s orientation and the camera which tends to drift to the wrong angle or make tom disappear all the time by that time you re probably getting pummeled or shot to death next if you re touching or almost touching an enemy and that s certainly going to be the case for hand to hand combat or when using melee weapons the fighting system which primarily consists of tapping or holding r is completely useless enemies can pummel you almost in a bear hug but you just can t move unless you back off so close fighting tends to consist of you yanking on the left analog stick yelling at the character to move away which it won t do of the time then tapping r as much as you can before the enemy gets too close again and makes r useless and if the enemy changes their angle to you in the meantime you re also going to struggle with the right analog stick to get your character oriented in the right way and to get the camera in position so you can see anything by that time you re probably getting pummeled or shot again and your only option will be to try to move the character away again my fights often consisted of making tom run circles around an area like a comedy film hoping that i could gain enough time to struggle with the analog stick and get a couple shots in before being at the ai s mercy again so much for realistic fighting and the same problems and more exist when trying to fight with guns if you re touching someone half the time the controller just won t allow you to fire off a shot yet they can still riddle you full of holes additionally there s no auto aim and the aiming system is ridiculously sensitive even with the sensitivity set to zero under options gunfights tend to consist of you hopelessly trying to aim or move away while the enemy puts shot after shot into you luckily or not damage seems to be recorded almost randomly it can take one to ten shots or more to incapacitate any character and there s no rhyme or reason to it you can put five shots into an enemy s head and near point blank range and they ll still return fire and hurt you yet the game designers seemed to care enough about realism than they built a recoil into your aiming system so after shots with powerful enough guns your aim will float off target and you ll have to fight with it again as for the celebrated graphics except for the characters and textures that you re close to they re actually pretty disappointing the distance always seems mostly empty and there are often expanses of flat colors and textures nearby when you re driving the city wasn t very well designed it s not varied enough and there aren t many interesting things to see or do the cars seem slow and they re difficult to control they also all drive about the same some have mentioned the music but that was also pretty nondescript a much better job could have been done on that end also as many others have mentioned the load times are ridiculous and constant they tend to be over a minute long and they occur between and in the middle of everything even races overall the mafia port to ps at least seems to have been very rushed the game feels and plays like an incomplete hack job,

      "Input: there s a sign on the lost highway that says major spoilers ahead but you already knew that didn t you since there s a great deal of people that apparently did not get the point of this movie i d like to contribute my interpretation of why the plot makes perfect sense as others have pointed out one single viewing of this movie is not sufficient if you have the dvd of md you can cheat by looking at david lynch s top hints to unlocking md but only upon second or third viewing please first of all mulholland drive is downright brilliant a masterpiece this is the kind of movie that refuse to leave your head not often are the comments on the dvds very accurate but vogue s it gets inside your head and stays there really hit the mark david lynch deserves praise for creating a movie that not only has a beautifully stylish look to it cinematography wise has great acting esp naomi watts a haunting soundtrack by badalamenti and a very dream like quality to it but on top of it all it also manages to involve the viewer in such a way that few movies have before after all when is the last time you saw a movie that just wouldn t leave your mind and that everyone felt compelled to talk and write about regardless of whether they liked it or hated it allright enough about all that it s time to justify those statements most people that have gone through some effort to try to piece the plot together will have come to the conclusion that the first half of the picture is an illusion a dream sequence of course that s too bad for all those trying to make sense of the movie by expecting traditional methods in which the story is laid out in a timely logic and linear manner for the viewer but for those expecting that i urge you to check the name of the director and come back again md is the story of the sad demise of diane selwyn a wannabe actor who is hopelessly in love with another actor camilla rowles due to diane s lack of talent she is constantly struggling to advance her career and feels she failed to deliver on her own and her parents expectations upon realizing that camilla will never be hers c becomes engaged with adam kesher the director she hires a hitman to get rid of her and subsequently has to deal with the guilt that it produces the movie first starts off with what may seem as a strange opening for this kind of thriller which is some s dance jitterbug contest in which we can see the main character betty giving a great performance we also see an elderly couple which we will see twice more throughout the movie together with her and applauding her no wait this is what most people see the first time they view it there s actually another very significant fact that is given before the credits the camera moving into an object although blurry and the scene quickly fading out if you look closely the object is actually a pillow revealing that what follows is a dream the main characters seen in the first half of the movie betty diane selwyn s imaginary self used in the first half of the movie that constitutes the dream sequence a positive portrayal of a successful aspiring young actor the complete opposite of diane betty was chosen as the name as that is the real name of the waitress at winkies notice that in the dream version the waitresses name is diane rita the fantasy version of camilla rhodes that through diane s dream and with the help of an imaginary car accident is turned into an amnesiac this makes her vulnerable and dependent on diane s love she is then conveniently placed in betty diane s aunt s luxurious home which betty has been allowed to stay in coco in real life adam s mother in the dream part the woman in charge of the apartment complex that betty stays in she s mainly a strong authority figure as can be witnessed in both parts of the film adam the director we know from the second half that he gets engaged with camilla his sole purpose for being in the first half of the movie is only to serve as a punching bag for betty diane since she develops such hatred towards him aunt ruth diane s real aunt but instead of being out of town she is actually dead diane inherited the money left by her aunt and used that to pay for camilla s murder mr roach a typical lynchian character not real appears only in diane s dream sequence he s a mysterious influential person that controls the chain of events in the dream from his wheelchair he serves much of the same function as the backwards talking dwarf which he also plays in twin peaks the hitman the person that murders camilla this character is basically the same in both parts of the movie although rendered in a slightly more goofy fashion in the dream sequence more on that below now having established the various versions of the characters in the movie we can begin to delve into the plot of course i will not go into every little detail neither will i lay it out chronologically but i will try to explain some of the important scenes in relation to lynch hint sheet as i mentioned above camilla was re produced as an amnesiac through her improbable survival of a car accident in the first minutes of the movie which left her completely vulnerable what i found very intriguing with md is that lynch constantly gives hints on what is real and what isn t i ve already mentioned the camera moving into the pillow but notice how there s two cars riding in each lane approaching the limo only one of the cars actually hit the limo what about the other even if they stayed clear of the accident themselves wouldn t they try to help the others or at least call for help my theory is that since this is a dream the presence of the other car is just set aside and forgotten about since as rogert ebert so eloquently puts it like real dreams it does not explain does not complete its sequences lingers over what it finds fascinating dismisses unpromising plotlines shortly after rita crawls down from the crash site at mulholland dr and makes her way down the hillside and sneaks into aunt ruth s apartment betty arrives and we see this creepy old couple driving away staring ghoulishly at each other and grinning at themselves and the camera this is the first indication that what we re seeing is a nightmare although the old couple seem to be unfamiliar to betty i think they re actually her parents since they were applauding her at the jitterbug contest perhaps she didn t know them all that well and didn t really have as good a relationship with them as she wanted so the couple is shown as very pleasant and helpful to her in the dream they also represent her feelings of guilt from the murder and diane s sense of unfulfillment regarding her unachieved goals in her life a rather long and hilarious scene is the one involving the hitman diane apparently sees him as the major force behind the campaign trying to pressure the director to accept camilla s part in the movie from adam s party in the second half of the movie and he therefore occupies a major part of her dream because of her feelings of guilt and remorse towards the murder of camilla a part of her wants him to miss so she turns him into a dumb criminal this scene i think is also lynch s attempt at totally screwing his audience over since they re given a false pretence in which to view the movie gotta love that something just bit me bad line though the next interesting scene is the one with the two persons at twinkies who are having a conversation about how one of them keep having this recurring nightmare involving a man which is seen by him through a wall outside of the diner that they re sitting in after a little talk they head outside and keep walking toward the corner of a fence accompanied of course by excellent music matching the mood of the scene when reaching the corner a bum like character with a disfigured face appears out from behind the corner scaring the living crap out of the man having the nightmare this nightmare exists only in diane s mind she saw that guy in the diner when paying for the murder so in short her obessions translate into that poor guy s nightmares the bum also signifies diane s evil side as can be witnessed later in the movie the cowboy constitutes along with the dwarf one of the strange characters that are always present in the lynchian landscape diane only saw him for a short while at adam s party but just like our own dreams can award insignificant persons that we hardly know a major part in our dreams so can he be awarded an important part in her dream we are also given further clues during his scenes that what we re seeing is not real his sudden disappearance etc the cowboy is also used as a tool to mock the director when he meets up with him at the odd location the lights here give a clear indication that this is part of a dream also notice how he says that he will appear one more time if he adam does good or two more times if he does bad throughout the movie he appears two more times indicating to diane that she did bad he is also the one to wake her up to reality that scene is probably an illusion made to fit into her requirements of him appearing twice and shortly thereafter she commits suicide the espresso scene with the castigliane brothers where we can see badalamenti the composer as luigi is probably a result of the fact that diane was having an espresso just before camilla and adam made their announcement at adam s party in the second half it could at the same time also be a statement from lynch during the scene in which they enter diane s apartment the body lying in the bed is camilla but notice how she s assumed diane s sleeping position diane is seeing herself in her own dream but the face is not hers although it had the same wounds on the face as diane would have after shooting herself this scene is also filled with some genuine lynchian creepiness since diane did not know where or when the hitman would get to camilla and finish her off she just put her into her own home in real life diane s audition for the movie part was bad in her dream she delivers a perfect audition leaving the whole crew ecstatic about her performance also interesting is the fact that the money that in real life was used to pay for camilla s murder now appears in rita camilla s purse this is part of diane s undoing of her terrible act by effectively being given the money back as the murder now hasn t taken place when her neighbor arrives to get her piano shaped ashtray another hint is given she takes the ashtray from her table and leaves yet later when camilla and betty have their encounter on the couch we see the ashtray appear again when the camera pans over the table suggesting that betty s encounter with the neighbor was a fantasy the catch phrase of the movie adam is auditioning actresses for is she is the girl which are the exact same words that diane uses when giving the hitman camilla s photo resume the blue box and the key represent the major turning point in the movie and is where the true identities of the characters are revealed there s much symbolism going on here the box may represent diane s future it s empty or it may be a sort of a pandora s box the hitman laughs when she asks him what the key will open either way it is connected to the murder by means of the blue key which is placed next to her after the murder has taken place the box is also seen at the end of the movie in the hands of the disfigured bum club silencio is a neat little addition to further remind the viewer that what s he is viewing is not real it also signifies that diane is about to wake up to her reality her reality being a nightmare that she is unable to escape from even in her dreams during the chilling scene at the end where the creepy old couple reappear diane is tormented in such a way that she sees suicide as the only way out in order to escape the screams and to avoid being haunted by her fears anyway that is my hope this could help people from bashing out at this movie and calling it the worst movie ever or something to that effect without realizing the plot as usual lynch is all about creating irrational fears

from the one you love cheating for years or has broken your heart to the point of being unable to open yourself up to the world love hurts the great thing about this film however is not in its portrayal of these lost souls trying to let their past heartbreaks go but in the eventual restart of new bonds for the future no one in this drama is perfect they are all at some degree trapped emotionally in relationships that they can t free themselves from alone there is some heavy subject material here and i credit binder for never making the story turn into a political diatribe but instead infusing the serious moments with some real nice comedic bits allowing the tale to stay character based and small in scale compared to the epic event that looms overhead what could have become a trite vehicle for opinions on how effected us all ends up being a story about two men and a connection they share that is the only thing which can save their lives from a life of depression and regret this is a new career performance for adam sandler i like to think that my favorite director paul thomas anderson was the first to see the childish pent up anger in his stupid comedies as something to use dramatically the juvenility of a character like billy madison allows for laughs and potty humor but also can be used to show a repressed man shy and shutout to the world around him a man with no confidence that needs an event of compassion to break him from his shell anderson let sandler do just that in his masterpiece punch drunk love and mike binder has taken it one step further sandler plays former dentist charlie fineman whose wife and three kids were killed in one of the planes that took down the world trade center on that one moment crushed any life that he had and as a result he became reclusive and started to believe he couldn t remember anything that happened before that day he really delivers a moving portrait of a man trying to keep up the charade in his head while those around him those that love him try and open him up to the reality of what happened and what the future holds always on edge and ready to snap at any moment when something is mentioned to spark the memory of his perished family he goes through life with his ipod and headphones shutting out everything so as not to be tempted remember reign over me is not about charlie fineman though it is about dentist and family man alan johnson a man that has trapped himself into a marriage and dental practice that both have stagnated into monotony johnson needs as much help in his life as his old college roommate charlie does played perfectly by the always brilliant don cheadle johnson has lost his backbone to try and change his life he has no friends and when he sees charlie by chance one day his life evolves into something he hasn t felt in years he revels in the chance to go out with an old friend no matter how much he has changed from the death of his family cheadle s character wants to revert back to the college days of hanging out and sandler s doesn t mind because all that was before he met his wife the two men get what they want and allow themselves to grow close despite the years of solitude that used to rule their lives once they begin opening up though it is inevitable that the subject of the tragedy will creep up and test the fa ade they have created for themselves the supporting cast does an amazing job helping keep up appearances for the two leads jada pinkett smith has never been an actress that impressed me and throughout the film played the tough as nails wife nicely but it is her final scene on the phone with cheadle that really showed me something different and true liv tyler is a bit out of her element as a psychiatrist but the movie calls her on this fact and makes the miscasting perfect casting the many small cameos are also effective even writer director mike binder s role as sandler s old best friend and accountant my only gripe here is why he feels the need to put his name in the opening credits as an actor when it is everywhere considering it is his film last but not least is the beautiful saffron burrows she is a great actress and plays the love crushed divorc e trying to put her life back together wonderfully a role that seems comic relief at first but ends up being an integral aspect for what is to come binder has crafted one of the best dramatic character studies i have seen in a long time the direction is almost flawless the blurring between cuts and characters in the fore background really annoyed me in the beginning the acting superb and the story true to itself never taking the easy way out or wrapping itself up with a neatly tied bow at the conclusion even the music was fantastic and used to enhance not to lead us emotionally why after two great uses of the titular song by the who did binder feel the need to use the inferior eddie veddar remake for the end i don t know but it did unfortunately stick out for me reign over me is a film about love and how although it can cause the worst pain imaginable it can also save us from regret and allow us to once again see the world as a place of beauty and hope,

      "Input: coming immediately on the heels of match point a fine if somewhat self repetitive piece of serious woody scoop gives new hope to allen s small but die hard band of followers among whom i number myself that the master has once again found his form a string of disappointing efforts culminating in the dreary melinda and melinda and the embarrassing anything else raised serious doubts that another first rate woody comedy with or without his own participation as an actor was in the cards happily the cards turn out to be a tarot deck that serves as scoop s clever maguffin and proffers an optimistic reading for the future of woody allen comedy even more encouraging woody s self casting sadly one of the weakest elements of his films in recent years is here an inspired bit of self parody as well as a humble recognition at last that he can no longer play romantic leads with women young enough to be his daughters or granddaughters in scoop allen astutely assigns himself the role of sid waterman an aging magician with cheap tricks and tired stage patter who much like woody himself has brought his act to london where audiences if not more receptive are at least more polite like chaplin s calvero in limelight sid waterman affords allen the opportunity to don the slightly distorted mask of an artist whose art has declined and whose audience is no longer large or appreciative moreover because they seem in character allen s ticks and prolonged stammers are less distracting here than they have been in some time waterman s character also functions neatly in the plot his fake magic body dissolving box becomes the ironically plausible location for visitations from joe strombel ian mcshane a notorious journalistic muckraker and recent cardiac arrest victim introduced on a river styx ferryboat to hades strombel repeatedly jumps ship because he just can t rest in eternity without communicating one last scoop about the identity of the notorious tarot killer unfortunately his initial return from the dead leads him to waterman s magic show and the only conduit for his hot lead turns out to be a journalism undergraduate sondra pransky scarlett johansson who has been called up from the audience as a comic butt for the magician s climactic trick sondra enthusiastically seizes the journalistic opportunity and drags the reluctant waterman into the investigation to play the role of her millionaire father as demonstrated in lost in translation johansson has a talent for comedy and the querulous by play between her and allen is very amusing and all the more so for never threatening to become a prelude to romance scoop s serial killer plot involving grisly murders of prostitutes and an aristocratic chief suspect peter lyman hugh jackman is the no doubt predictable result of allen s lengthy sabbatical exposure to london s ubiquitous jack the ripper landmarks and lore yet other facets of scoop as of match point also derive from woody s late life encounter with english culture its class structure manners idiom dress architecture and yes peculiar driving habits give woody fresh new material for wry observation of human behavior as well as sharp social satire when for instance sondra is trying to ingratiate herself with peter lyman at a ritzy private club waterman observes from his point of view we re scum a good deal of humor is also generated by the contretemps of stiffly reserved british social manners encountering waterman s insistent borscht belt jewish plebeianism and then of course there is waterman s hilarious exit in a smart car he can t remember to drive on the left side of the road as usual allen s humor in scoop includes heavy doses of in jokes taking the form of sly allusions to film and literary sources as well as increasingly references to his own filmography in addition to the pervasive jack the ripper references for instance the film s soundtrack is dominated by an arrangement of grieg s the hall of the mountain king compulsively whistled by hans beckert in m the first masterpiece of the serial killer genre the post funeral gathering of journalists who discuss the exploits of newly departed joe strombel clearly mimics the opening of broadway danny rose references to deconstructing harry include the use of death as a character along with his peculiar voice and costume the use of mandelbaum as a character name and the mention of adair university harry s alma mater and where sondra is now a student moreover the systematic use of greek mythology in the underworld river cruise to hades recalls the use of greek gods and a chorus in mighty aphrodite as to quotable gags allen s scripts rely less on one liners than they did earlier in his career but scoop does provides at least a couple of memorable ones to a question about his religion waterman answers i was born in the hebrew persuasion but later i converted to narcissism and sondra snaps off this put down of waterman s wannabe crime

something i hadn t seen before i didn t that s because it s so real to me another user wrote the ages of the commentators should be shown with their summary i m all for that it s absolutely obvious that most of these people who ve made comments about midnight cowboy may not have been born when it was released they are mentioning other movies jon voight and dustin hoffman have appeared in at a later time i ll be just as ruinously frank i am years old if you re familiar with some of my other comments you ll be aware that i was a professional female impersonator for of those years and also have appeared in film you d never recognize me even if you were familiar with my night club persona do you think i know a lot about the characters in this film you bet i do and am not the least bit ashamed if you haven t run into some of them it s your loss but there s a huge chance you have but just didn t know it so many moms dads sons and daughters could surprise you it should be no secret many actors actresses have emerged from the backgrounds of midnight cowboy who is to judge i can name several current big time stars who were raised on the seedy streets of many cities and weren t the least bit damaged by their time spent there i make no judgment because these are humans just as we all are love courage kindness compassion intelligence humility you name the attributes they are all there no matter what the package looks like the trivia about hoffman actually begging on the streets to prove he could do the role of ratzo is a gem he can be seen driving his auto all around los angeles how do you think he gets his input i can also name lots of male stars who have stood on the streets and cruised the bars for money although the nightclub i last worked in for years was world famous and legit i can also name some huge stars that had to be constantly chased out our back street looking to make a pick up this should be no surprise today although it s definitely action in hollywood and other cities large and small wake up and smell the roses they smell no less sweet because they are of a different hue some of the users thought joe buck had been molested by his grandma although i saw him in her bed with a boyfriend i didn t find any incidence of that believe it or not kids haven t always had their own rooms because that is a must today should tell you something kinda kinky may be going on in the master bedroom whose business hoffman may have begged for change on the streets but some of the users point out that jon voight was not a major star for the filming of midnight cowboy his actual salary would surprise you i think he was robbed no one can doubt the clarity he put into his role nor that it made him a star for such great work as deliverance he defined a potent man who had conquered his devils and was the better for it few people commented he had been sodomized in this movie the end of the s may have been one of the first films to be so open but society has always been hip i also did not find any homosexuality between ratzo and joe they were clearly opposites unappealing to one another they found a much purely higher relationship true friendship if you didn t understand that at the end of the movie then you ve wasted your time joe s bewilderment but unashamed devotion was apparent yes voight deserved an oscar for this role one that john wayne could never pull off and he was as handsome in his youth hoffman is hoffman you expect fireworks he gave them superbly wayne got his oscar every character in this film was beautifully defined if you don t think they are still around you are mistaken the party attend some of the raves younger people attend if you can get in look at the lines of people trying to get into the hot clubs you ll see every outrageous personality brenda viccaro was the epitome of society s sleek women who have to get down to the nitty gritty at times if you were shocked by her brilliant acting thinking this isn t real look at today s ladies who live on the brink of disrepute and are admired for it the brutality joe displayed in robbing the old guy unfortunately is also a part of life you don t have to condone it but it s not too much different than any violence joe pointedly named his purpose in that situation i d have handed over the money quicker than he asked for it that s one of

      "Input: no this isn t a sequel to the fabulous ova series but rather a remake of the events that occurred after the death of ghim and the disappearance of woodchuck it is also more accurate to the novels that inspired this wonderful series which is why characters namely orson and shiris are reintroduced and why the story may seem slightly different to those used to the ova the booklet included in the set provides excellent answers to such questions as do various online sites the first eight episodes of this part tv series focus on the fateful battle at demon dragon mountain the remaining episodes introduce us to spark a blue haired knight wannabe who identifies with parn and his ragtag team of misfits as they attempt to stop the dark wizard wagnard from resurrecting kardis the destroyer while it isn t quite the equivalent of the original lodoss war we all love the finale where parn saves deedlit from wagnard don t we this tv follow up is still great fun for fantasy fans even if the animation is limited and a step down from the artistic streak of the first lodoss this part series has its elements of appeal the fully realized characters engaging storyline magic romance and a superb soundtrack scored by kaoru wada of ninja scroll all give this uneven spin off some punch while the ova dub of lodoss has been criticized for one reason or another i generally liked it and still consider it one of my favorite dubs so i had significant hopes for the dub for chronicles made in for the most part the lodoss tv english track is of passable if not stellar quality it does however have its share of problems much of the original cast who lent their english voices to the characters of lodoss return including lisa ortiz as deedlit which is a nice bonus on the other hand billy regan s more mature sounding parn is a bit offputting he doesn t do a bad job but his voice came across as grating for the first eight episodes causing some anti dub fans to instantly diss the dub but by the time spark and company take the stage i found it less bothersome i don t know if it s because he improved or if it just grew on me also not everyone from the oav dub returns jayce reeves only voices wagnard terrifically for one episode he s replaced by pete zarustica for the whole show who gives a scratchy but still malevolent turn as well as the expected evil laughter anthony cruise s kashue on the other hand is too weary and takes about five or so episodes to find his stride oliver gregory is probably the most effective as orson especially during his final dramatic scenes aside from lisa ortiz deedlit karen smith shiris john knox ashram and al muscari slayn the dub s best voices come from some of the newer characters including crispin freeman spark maar garrack episodes roxanne beck little neese meg frances who voices pirotess in the oav but also voices ryna with vulnerability and sassiness as well as karla and especially angora deb who steals every scene she s in as leaf the half elf the rest of the cast isn t terrible by any means but a little more uneven than the oav dub some are all right aldonova greevus while others are lackluster hobb palace guards dragons etc and few were awful in particular prince reona s va is too harsh and monotone for a fighter of justice in fact the lack of aural continuity some cast members get new voices for some unexplained reason by the time we get to some of the later episodes is one of the problems of the dub others include less memorable and more awkward sounding dialogue uneven synchronization and finally i apologize in advance to the fans of this the lodoss island segments these offbeat super deformed interludes at the end of each episode will either amuse or drive you batty admittingly i at first found them to be a major nuisance but they sorta grew on me after a while besides there are some showstoppingly hilarious lines such as i m king kashue and this is my cashew i m really quite a nut these flaws rank the dub for chronicles just a notch just below that for the ova resulting in an uneven english track summed up best as ok if one wonders if the japanese language track is the preferred listening choice well guess what the japanese version has its good and bad points too while some voices are less annoying than the english language track i found others to be less appealing than the english equivalents in particular the actress who does deedlit is nowhere nearly as good as lisa ortiz or yumi tohma plus i should mention that the japanese cast is not the same as the ova because the series was made seven years after the original all but one sho hayami of the cast members are replaced by new ones although they do a respectably good job it may be a major annoyance for those who were used to the japanese ova cast shows that not everything in japanese is better than english eh despite its flaws chronicles of the heroic knight is still a fine series which deserves to hold its own ground its not without its rough spots and doesn t always live up to its predecessor yet there s enough good points to counter the bad making this a moderately enjoyable fantasy anime,

      "Input: peter jacksons version s are better films overall from objective point of view that being said they are not my favorite screen versions of lord of the rings and let me explain why firstly the acting of the on screen characters is just too ordinary and uninspiring with jackson s lotr the whole cast is too run of the mill are you claiming that those silly cartoon characters of ralph bakshi version are better actors than real people one could ask well they are not really silly save for hobbits later about them and they certainly pack more personality than jackson s party even with much more limited dialogue time and that is because of superior voice acting of the bakshi s lotr take aragorn for example in this version his voice is deep and charismatic with full of authority aragorn the lord and with a seasoned rasp aragorn the ranger this is due to john hurt s brilliant voice acting compare that to viggo mortensen s rather high pitched sound with no soul and the duel gets quickly uneven hurt beats mortensen hands down and then there is gandalf probably the most dominating and the most popular character in the whole saga in this bakshi version gandalf william squire is a real wizard and by that i don t mean he shoots bolts from his fingertips he does not but his presence is just captivating he is a mystical powerful and can switch from gentle old man to a scary person with ease add to that his looks tall old as the ancient oak beard long as his body sharp eyes wizardy hook nose and of course the classical wizard hat a perfect gandalf just like in the books ian mckellen s gandalf in the other hand is simply just too boring he looks too human sounds too human acts too human and wears no hat or wields no sword yes a sword in this bakshi version gandalf scores couple of bloody orc kills with his sword as he did in the books and those are stylish slow motion kills gandalf is not a power to be messed with and it must be noted that while i m sad to say this the great christopher lee didn t bring saruman alive fraser kerr in this movie did even with a very limited screen time and lines before i move completely to visual aspects of the movie it must be mentioned that the voice acting and the general presenation of the orcs are also superior to jackson s pretendeous bad guys bakshi s orcs taunt their enemies or each other constantly with growls screams and nasty language they are more believable as monsters and are more faithful to the book in my opinion and finally the black riders or the nazgul those ultimate bad guys are scary ghosts in this one not just some riders wearing black and they speak with haunting voice which mesmerizes their victim my favorite scene in the film is when the nazgul are chasing frodo near the river while peter jackson couldn t do anything but show the riders simply chasing the party bakshi throws in a nightmarish dream with some cool slow motion scenes and thundering sky but as much i like this film more than jackson s the latter are if only technically still better and that is because of some key visuals as you know bakshi lotr features a mixture of animated characters all hobbits and the main cast and real actors covered with paint i don t really have a problem using real people in animation this way but they just don t fit very well with traditional cartoon figures this is especially true with humans riders of rohan tavern people etc orcs are different matter since they are meant to look very distinctive from other characters orcs while played by humans with animation mix look far superior to jacksons version they have brownish green skin shiny red eyes flat face and pointed teeth biggest screw up in this films visuals howerver are the hobbits while i prefer almost every character in bakshi version compared to jackson the latter has clearly superior hobbits in fact they are perfect with bakshi you get some irritating and rather poorly drawn humanoid disney bambies and you are forced to spend a lot of movie time with them so be warned again the voice acting is ok with them too but the actors mouths cannot save the immersion damage made by these little weasels well i never really liked those halflings anyway general failures in the bakshi script are well known limited playing time with limited budget and a lot of missing scenes so while this film covers nearly half of the story it doesn t do it in extensive detail compared to jackson s version in a summary the ralph bakshi version of lotr has a superior overall atmosphere it feels more like middle earth overall voice acting music i really dig the fantasy score by kont rosenman gandalf aragorn one of the john hurt s finest roles king theoden orcs black riders elrond he s not some fairy hippie in this one while jackson version is better because it covers the whole story overall visuals and special effects gollum smeagol balrog hobbits lord of the rings by ralph bakshi even with it s well known shortcomings is one of the best animation films ever made and it captures the atmosphere of tolkien s fantasy world very well if not perfectly i ll give it a score of out of, Predicted: [1.], Actual:

      "Input: it s almost impossible for me to sit down and write a conscientious review of three colors red without letting people in on some of the ideas that krysztoff kieszlowski has explored in the previous two entries to this fascinating trilogy the more i see them and think of them and imagine myself in their world the more i get its theme that we are more linked to each other than we would want to think ourselves and all it takes is a little hand of fate to set some events in motion in blue juliette binoche played a grieving widow whose plan to live her life without connections to the past had her meet someone unexpected in white an act of cruelty spawns an unlikely friendship between two men who will against the odds conspire to bring the perpetrator to justice and full circle and now in red all the elements of fate and apparent coincidence apply themselves into the meeting of a young genevese model and a retired judge who has a habit of prying into other people s lives this young girl is appropriately named valentine a luminous irene jacob who has this radiance about her and even smiles openly while working the runway not that she is without some baggage she has a boyfriend unseen who also demands to know what she is doing at all times she has a brother who troubles her and she rejects the advances of a photographer who is working on her image for a huge billboard she strikes a dog while driving and nurses her back to health but when she takes her to the owner a retired judge jean louis trintingnant he does not want her i want nothing he coldly says and elements of blue suddenly reveal themselves as this arrogant man who also lives in anonymity and apparent free floating freedom conducts surveillance on unsuspecting people this male version of juliette binoche s character at first shocks valentine she states she can only feel pity for him as she walks away in horror but a chance event has her back at his place and here is when he begins revealing who he is and his great loss at the same time kieszlowski is unfolding a parallel story the story of a young man auguste jean pierre lorit about to become a judge and who lives right across the street from valentine but they keep missing each other chance is the word like valentine winning the jackpot at the grocery story she visits elements of chance pepper her life and auguste s he has a girlfriend who also supplies people with telephoned reports about the weather one of them happens to be the old judge he knows more about her than auguste does and he s never met her like god or prospero he is slowly creating a storm which will crack the walls of this present state of conformity and bring a new meaning to the expression we meet again it s this parallelism between the old and young judge that makes red so beautiful and transcendent because time is in reality a lot more fluid than we would like to deem it there are people whom we meet in life that if only we had been born in similar time frames so many things would be different such is the case with valentine and the old judge i believe that there is definitely a strong fraternity of souls tying them together in a tight bond she is that woman whom he did not meet by chance or not and is whether he knows it or not trying to make amends hence why he goes to the great risk of revealing his surveillance and becoming the social outcast but it doesn t end there one of the many links between the three movies is the character of an old woman walking to a large garbage container where julie did not see her and would not have helped her anyhow and karol fresh from his public humiliation sneers at her thinking someone is worse off than i am valentine is the one who helps her frailty in need can happen anywhere and kieszlowski even applies it here in a minor character now red is so much more than a story valentine the old judge auguste even rita the dog these aren t characters confined by storytelling an american version would ruin the idea and commercialize chance encounters and even bring forth a dumbed down ending red is so devoid of a linear defined plot that anything could happen to any of these people and the possibilities that this story could have veered off in so many directions had one crucial element not taken place at the exact moment and place adding to the concept of characters who mirror each other despite time frames or location is the theme of sexual betrayal this is also an important and character defining element in all of the three films in blue julie s husband had a mistress and she also betrays olivier when it s become clear she s emotionally dead in white dominique has karol listen to her moan over the phone which becomes an important device in red as she has sex with a man while the billboard of brigite bardot s contempt looks on in red the old judge s tale of love and betrayal gets re enacted and all this time valentine s billboard image looms over them like a presage of what is to come at the same time that rita the dog valentine s car struck bears seven pups life renewed for the six major players in this complex trilogy obviously

      "Input: i have not read a time to kill by john grisham and perhaps that would have helped understand the film better but perhaps not i hear this is the most faithful grisham adaption yet and if that is true i can see why so many publishers turned down the novel when grisham introduced it as his first work a time to kill is one of those films that is seriously confused and wants to do too many things at once it wants to be a suspenseful crowd pleasing thriller and at the same time a film dedicated to exploring certain social and moral questions let s face it those two types of films do not go together in hollywood which is why dead man walking had to be made independently the story involves a young lawyer named jake matthew mcconaughy out to defend a black man named carl samuel l jackson from murdering two hillbillies that brutally raped his young daughter the day before the rapists trial carl hid in a closet in the courthouse and when the rapists were brought through the building he charged out and shot both of them dead to help out with the defense jack accepts the help of a former law student sandra bullock who proves that her role in this film was totally unnecessary and put in the film only for marketing purposes meanwhile one of the rapist s kid brother kiefer sutherland was angered that a black man killed his brother and decided to act out a revenge all of this leads to a shooting in front of the courthouse a kidnapping a brutal beating and race riot i ll admit that all of this held my attention greatly throughout the film in addition to the courtroom scenes what i later objected to was the film s handling of ethical questions and its use of formulas in the plot the main question that the film constantly asks over and over again is whether a black man gets a fair trial from a white jury sure they can but that doesn t mean that the man has to be acquitted in order for the trial to be fair this film however doesn t seem to think so besides that there several gaping holes in the plot used for conveniences for example there is an unknown character called mickey mouse who is a member of the klan and for reasons unknown is helping the members of the defense team escape from serious dangers of the other members of the klan after bullock is kidnapped by sutherland and company and left for dead in the wilderness this unknown person comes and saves her and we never find out who he is and why he is helping out the people he should be terrorizing and speaking of the sutherland character s reign of terror it s amazing how witless the police and the bullock character are in stopping him throughout the film there s a scene when sutherland becomes a sniper from a building across the street from the courthouse and tries to shoot jake as he comes out shooting one of the guards instead now you d think since there are dozens of police around it would be easy to surround and capture the sniper no such luck from what we could see no one seemed to even care that a sniper was still on the loose even after bullock was rescued by mickey mouse she never ever mentioned who her kidnapper was nor was it even questioned why was this simple the sutherland character was needed throughout the film to add continual suspense although logically he should have been out of the picture besides bullock s character there another thankless character he is jake s assistant played by oliver platt there seems to be one reason for his character to be in the movie to supply a number of one liners for the audience in my opinion one liners show a major weakness in serious films when used it demonstrates that the filmmakers are not confident that the story and dialogue alone are enough to keep the audience s attention and so use them to make the audience laugh to reassure everyone that they are watching an entertaining film but enough of the film s many minor problems what about the film s message here it is clear that carl is indeed guilty of murder we saw how he planned for hours to murder the men who raped his daughter the lawyers argue that it was temporary insanity etc that caused him to kill in desperation jake asks the jury to close their eyes as he recounts the rape in detail as part of his closing arguement after describing everything that took place he adds on one final line the girl is white we then see members of the jury with tears in their eyes in the very next scene a girl comes out yelling he s free he s free wait a minute do juries base their verdicts on their emotions or on the facts most of all why weren t there any scenes that showed the jury deliberating and what they were really thinking after their emotions worn off i ll tell you why they couldn t show the delibertion because no jury could acquit a man of such a crime no matter how much the defense s closing arguements touched their hearts what is the message that someone is justified in killing if it is a form of revenge for a previous crime done to them this film should have had the courage to say that murder is not ok in this situation because in reality there would not be an acquittal but since dollars were at stake the filmmakers were more concerned about sparing the audiences feelings than they were about presenting a responsible message if people start killing as a form of revenge the makers of this film should be held responsible what a socially irresponsible film this is, Predicted: [2.0756143e-11], Actual: 0\n",

      "Input: i usually start by relaying the premise of the film but before anyone makes any hasty judgments about my review let me preface it by saying that i m someone who likes most films just check my other reviews alone in the dark is a film by director uwe boll whose film right before this one was house of the dead like alone in the dark it was also a film adaptation of a video game almost everyone hated it well i loved it i even gave it a out of my point in stating this which will surely turn some readers off immediately is that if even i hated alone in the dark there must be something wrong with it the premise who am i kidding attempting to state a premise for this film is about as easy as trying to balance the united states budget but here it goes anyway some archaeologists discovered evidence of some lost american indian tribe the indian tribe apparently had discovered some means of broaching the second world which was evil in nature the bad stuff wiped them out but not before they could lock the door to the evil world and throw away the key later some scientist government researcher who had been experimenting with the paranormal and specifically this tribe decided to experiment on some kids to try to produce some kind of hybrid with the second world believe it or not everything up to this point and then some is told to us in a written prologue to the film it s just white text scrolling across a black screen with a voice over also reading it to us then there was something about the kids being in an orphanage but the government takes them back out and then a bunch of people are searching for archaeological relics and there are super humans roaming around and a bunch of military people are called in and on and on in fact the exposition never really stops it s like a neverending backstory from hell there are enough ideas here to fill at least films maybe but not one of them is presented in a coherent way to create one good film in addition to the mystical lost indian tribe and the superhumans we also get monsters that resemble a cross between alien and a werewolf worms that invade your body and turn into snake like aliens tunneling worms underground zombies starship trooper like wars evil scientists underground lairs gold mines spooky warehouses impalements big mostly unused museums government conspiracies golden trunks pulled out of the sea nuns explosions complex backstabbing plots a very ambiguous romance car chases home invasions kitchen sinks wait i can t remember if that last one was in the film even more amazingly amusingly in fangoria producer shawn williamson was quoted as saying we re spending much more time on story being very meticulous about that tara reid called alone in the dark a smarter film let me not mislead anyone a lot of that stuff above might sound yummy to the potential audience for this film but the problem is that nothing has the slightest connection to anything else i usually had no idea what any setting s relation was to any other setting why we were there or what anyone was doing at least when each scene began it s just a random mishmash of settings and clich s as if director uwe boll had unrelated ideas in a hat and pulled them out like lottery numbers then when he was done he and editor richard schwadel decided to cut the film by using dice then reassembled it by throwing the i ching sometimes the film plays like an extended director s reel which is a combination of short varied unrelated scenes that directors circulate to try to get work but perhaps that s being too generous i m not sure boll would get work if this were his reel just as i tend to at least like most films i tend to like most actors and most performances it s very rare that i say that a performance was bad well tara reid was bad here and i m someone who usually likes reid i don t know what happened for a large percentage of the film they just move her around the set like a prop they might as well have just bought a blow up doll that would have saved them money that they could have used for some cgi ghosts and vampires in castle and graveyard settings maybe they chose to move her around like a pretty piece of driftwood after they saw the dailies of her mumbling nonsense dialogue in a monotone that s usually reserved for entertaining mother in laws and speaking of that dialogue a lot of alone in the dark plays like a godzilla film without godzilla by that i mean that it s a lot of pseudo scientific gobbledy gook at least in godzilla films there s a campiness to it because they know how ridiculous it is and there s a big payoff in that we get to see godzilla destroy downtown and battle a giant gnat with radioactive death beams shooting from its eyes or something just what stephen dorff and christian slater are doing here besides overacting and filing lawsuits against their agents is difficult to say i can t say that i thought anyone in the film had a decent performance although maybe slater at least saw the cigar i think that s unprecedented for me still i didn t give this film a there was some competent cinematography even if boll and schwadel made mincemeat out of it and the hard rock tunes over the end credits were good heck even the novelette prologue wasn t so bad i actually thought the film had promise at that point but this may just
